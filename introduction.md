# Introduction and Motivation

I recently learned that several hundred houses are due to be built on the site of a Medieval farmstead called Turnden that I happen to be quite familiar with.
I was saddened by this and quite surprised that it had been given the green light; amongst other concerns, the farmstead located within a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).
AONBs enjoy a protected status similar to that of the National Parks.
The [National Planning Policy Framework](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-planning-policy-framework/15-conserving-and-enhancing-the-natural-environment) states that

> When considering applications for development within National Parks, the Broads and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, permission should be refused for major development other than in **exceptional circumstances**, and where it can be demonstrated that the development is in the public interest. - NPPF Paragraph 176 (20/07/2021) (emphasis mine)

In the case of Turnden, the local planning authority felt that the proposal constituted "exceptional circumstances" based on two factors:
1. Housing need. See [TWBC Statement of Case](https://twbcpa.midkent.gov.uk/online-applications/files/0A6593E69A58D64A3B21CD96DA332D02/pdf/20_00815_FULL-TWBC_Statement_of_Case-4182036.pdf) paragraph 5.44.
2. "The provision of 21.60% Biodiversity Net Gain". See paragraph 5.34.

As a physicist scanning through very wordy planning documents, this 21.60% figure inevitably drew my interest.
What techniques did they use to estimate this quantity?
The precision seems quite high...what sort of uncertainties have they accounted for?
More fundamentally, what is their operational definition of biodiversity?

Unfortunately, the reality is that the Metric looks more and more problematic the closer one looks.

==Work in progress==


In fact the 21.60% figure from Turnden results is erroneous.
If the official guidance is followed then the true figure (using the most up-to-date version) is 60%.
This impressive result is actually acheived through a quite simple strategy: the applicants propose to sprinkle wildflower seeds on some fairly bog-standard grassland.
There is also a caveat that all of the soil that will be displaced during the build stage will be dumped on top of the existing grassland, destroying much of the existing biodiversity (but conveniently cutting costs for the developers).

I am not alone in strongly disputing the notion that one can build 170 houses on a greenfield site while simultaneously increasing the amount of biodiversity by 60%.
The fact that this is justified by the *promise* that a destroyed grassland habitat will be restored to a much higher standard is beyond farcical.

Even so, to my knowledge there have not been many examples of people going publically and on-record to voice their criticism.
Notable exceptions from the academic community are [this article by Professor Kathy Willis](https://oxlel.zoo.ox.ac.uk/4428) and [this research paper by zu Ermgassen et al.](https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12820).
